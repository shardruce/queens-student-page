For collaborators:

Go to your partner’s repo → Pull requests tab → open the PR titled Peer Review: Click Files changed → hover a line → click the blue + to add a comment on that exact spot. To suggest an edit, click Insert a suggestion (the UI button) → type the corrected code or text → Add review comment. Use the Conversation tab for general notes (e.g., broken link, contrast issue) and include a screenshot if helpful. When you’ve left at least 5 comments (see checklist below), click Review changes (top-right) → choose Comment or Approve (or Request changes if something must be fixed) → Submit review.

To edit images:

Go to the main repository and upload a file. Change the filename to a title that describes the image. Open index.html and change the name of the previous image in line 17 to the updated one. Commit change.
